Olive is a very straightforward application, allowing users to have a fully customizable web application for tracking client intake.  

The Olive project was started as I saw nonprofits often do not have resources to keep track of clients who use their services. Often, this means lengthy paper trails, no high-level technology access, and no resources to create software.

With Olive, users can configure exactly what information they need to collect from clients such as name, email, phone, and so on. From there, the application will generate a web forms to create new users. Users can check clients into their service, see when they were last served, and generate reports from interactive queries.
