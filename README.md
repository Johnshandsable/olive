Olive is a very simple application, allowing users to use web forms to query databases, collect and store client data, and just generally keep track of all the data in a concise way. 

Olive was started as I saw a need in the way that nonprofits often do not have resources to keep track of clients who use their services. And let's face it, nobody wants to use paper trails especially when you're serving hundreds or even thousands of clients. 

With Olive, you can decide exactly what information you want to collect from your clients such as name, email, phone, and so on. From there, the application will generate a web form to create new users. Users can check clients into their service, see when they were last served, and generate reports from interactive queries.
